He is fiercely loyal and nearly fearless in battle. \r\n\r\nLuke\u2019s unbreakable skin and super strength make him the bruiser out of all the trainees. He\u2019s the first guy to jump into a fight. However, he can still be hurt by concussive blasts and other forms of energy.\r\n\r\nAs Danny\u2019s best friend, Luke is the translator for Danny\u2019s sometimes spacey, non-sequitur comments. Luke will always be the first to defend Peter from others, both as civilians and Super Heroes.", "comics": {"available": 0, "items": [], "returned": 0, "collectionURI": "http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters/1016840/comics"}, "series": {"available": 0, "items": [], "returned": 0, "collectionURI": "http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters/1016840/series"}, "modified": "2013-09-18T15:54:58-0400", "id": 1016840, "stories": {"available": 0, "items": [], "returned": 0, "collectionURI": "http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters/1016840/stories"}, "urls": [{"url": "http://marvel.com/comics/characters/1016840/power_man_usm?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=87308d184f29de11b1b74d207abb8971", "type": "detail"}], "events": {"available": 0, "items": [], "returned": 0, "collectionURI": "http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters/1016840/events"}, "thumbnail": {"path": "http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/3/00/52321806b45cf", "extension": "jpg"}, "name": "Power Man (USM)"}
